Do you have the dev environment ready? https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking if not.\nIf you have dev environment issues, you can get in help on IRC on #introduction or #devtools for devtools-specific problems.\n\nOnce in place, you can start looking at the code:\n- /toolkit/devtools/server/actors/script.js\n  This is the server-side code that has a reference to the object that will be previewed in the console and that creates a preview for it\n- /browser/devtools/webconsole/console-output.js\n  This contains the client-side code that actually renders the preview on to the console.\n\nI think this bug should be solvable by changing the server-side code only.\nAs Panos said in comment 1, we are probably just not creating the right preview for pseudo-arrays. We need to find a way to detect these types of objects, and create a preview just like we do for Arrays.\n\nIn /toolkit/devtools/server/actors/script.js, search for DebuggerServer.ObjectActorPreviewers.Object, you'll see a list of functions that the previewer mechanism uses, one by one, until it finds one that actually can preview the object.\nIn there, there's one function called ArrayLike, which is the one we use to preview things like String lists, attribute maps, css rules, etc...\n\nMy take on this bug is that we add a new function right after this one, called PseudoArray or something.\nThis function would check if the object passed has a 'length' property that is a positive, finite, integer, and would also check if the object has positive, finite, integer properties from 0 to length-1.\nIf the object passed in validate these conditions, then this function should add the \"ArrayLike\" preview kind and length and items to the grip object just like the ArrayLike function does.",

Open the WebIDE (either from the menu at the end of the navigation bar [might require customization before] or by pressing the Alt key and selecting Tools > Web developer > WebIDE.\n2. In the toolbar, select the first button and create a new app \"app1\", select the Hello World app, create a new folder for storing the app.\n3. Create a new app \"app2\" like in 2.\n4. Select the manifest.webapp file.\n5. Change the description value from \"A Hello World app\" to \"A Hello World app helps debugging\".\n6. Use the first button to switch to app1.\n7. Switch back to app2.\nActual result: Change from 5. is gone.\nExpected result: Firefox should warn if there are unsaved changes when switching the app (6.) like when you try to close the WebIDE window.\n\nThe 'Quit' version works like this:\n1. Quit command gets registered at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#896\n2. When the Quit command gets called, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#96 get executed\n3.

Open the WebIDE (either from the menu at the end of the navigation bar [might require customization before] or by pressing the Alt key and selecting Tools > Web developer > WebIDE.\n2. In the toolbar, select the first button and create a new app \"app1\", select the Hello World app, create a new folder for storing the app.\n3. Create a new app \"app2\" like in 2.\n4. Select the manifest.webapp file.\n5. Change the description value from \"A Hello World app\" to \"A Hello World app helps debugging\".\n6. Use the first button to switch to app1.\n7. Switch back to app2.\nActual result: Change from 5. is gone.\nExpected result: Firefox should warn if there are unsaved changes when switching the app (6.) like when you try to close the WebIDE window.\n\nThe 'Quit' version works like this:\n1. Quit command gets registered at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#896\n2. When the Quit command gets called, http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#96 get executed\n3. This calls http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/projecteditor/lib/projecteditor.js#752\n\nThe project switching itself happens at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webide/content/webide.js#989"

The text is sized in em, and the background image in px. We need to make sure that the text and the image fit irrespective of the font size in use. You may need to use calc( NNem + MMpx) for some sizes in order to ensure that both text and image fit properly.\n\nDoes this seem like something you'll be able to do, and is that more clear?",

Sorry about the long wait, we've all been very busy with the Firefox Developer Edition :)\n\nTo fix this bug, you'll need some good knowledge about how the 2D and WebGL canvas contexts work. We'll need to provide support for both, since the canvas debugger should be able to work regardless of which is used. Therefore, we'll need two different implementations in the \"backend\", that abstract the same interface over the remote debugging protocol. Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds :)\n\nFor 2D contexts, I'd say things are relatively easy. To highlight overdraws, starting with a black background, we can perform our own drawing operations on a separate canvas at the same time with the original ones, using a semi-transparent fill that \"builds up\" with every draw call. The logic for replaying 2D canvas operations is already available here: [0]. Make sure you read the documentation there too.\n\nWith WebGL, it's a bit more tricky, but possible nonetheless. The idea is the same as with the 2D context, but we can either:\n* use a custom semi-transparent fill pixel shader, but keeping the original vertex shader, or\n* use some depth buffer diffing magic\n* use a custom blend mode\nTo me, it sounds like using a custom blend mode is much more implementation-friendly. Using custom shaders is going to be hard to get right and maintain all the correct bindings. Depth buffer render targets and querying might not be supported on all hardware. Therefore, all you'd have to do is set a constant color and alpha source, and an `add` blend equation. You could also set a color mask beforehand, if we know we're only going to draw red, for example.\n\nThe frontend implementation is at [1]. And you probably guessed it, the backend is at [2]\n\nTo build Firefox from source and start hacking, just follow the simple steps here: [3]\n\n[0] http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/canvas.js?from=canvas.js#586\n[1] http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/canvasdebugger\n[2] dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/canvas.js\n[3] https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking",

Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds :)\n\nFor 2D contexts, I'd say things are relatively easy. To highlight overdraws, starting with a black background, we can perform our own drawing operations on a separate canvas at the same time with the original ones, using a semi-transparent fill that \"builds up\" with every draw call. The logic for replaying 2D canvas operations is already available here: [0]. Make sure you read the documentation there too.\n\nWith WebGL, it's a bit more tricky, but possible nonetheless. The idea is the same as with the 2D context, but we can either:\n* use a custom semi-transparent fill pixel shader, but keeping the original vertex shader, or\n* use some depth buffer diffing magic\n* use a custom blend mode\nTo me, it sounds like using a custom blend mode is much more implementation-friendly. Using custom shaders is going to be hard to get right and maintain all the correct bindings. Depth buffer render targets and querying might not be supported on all hardware. Therefore, all you'd have to do is set a constant color and alpha source, and an `add` blend equation. You could also set a color mask beforehand, if we know we're only going to draw red, for example.\n\nThe frontend implementation is at [1]. And you probably guessed it, the backend is at [2]\n\nTo build Firefox from source and start hacking, just follow the simple steps here: [3]\n\n[0] http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/canvas.js?from=canvas.js#586\n[1] http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/canvasdebugger\n[2] dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/canvas.js\n[3] https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Hacking"

Only API widgets get destroyed, and as you say, there the endresult is the same. Why do you need to undo things you did when the widget was removed if the widget was destroyed?\n\nSeparately, under what circumstances does the widget get destroyed without you knowing, that is, isn't it always you who destroys the widget? Seeing as all the code is sync, that sounds like you should know, too, when the handler gets called, if you're in the process of destroying your widget or not...\n\nIt sounds like I'm missing something.

Why do you need to undo things you did when the\n> widget was removed if the widget was destroyed?\nBasically I have my API-based widgets working in a way as if they were XUL-based, in the sense that when removing them from a toolbar, their nodes end up in the palette element of the toolbox, instead of being removed altogether (I need them somewhere, whether in the palette or somewhere else is irrelevant, but I can't have the nodes completely destroyed; I just use the palette for this because that's what it's there for anyway).\n\nChecking for the aWasRemoval flag of onWIdgetAfterDOMChange, I can move the node as I want; but because onWidgetDestroyed now also fires those, I would have to undo that (remove the node from the palette) in that case by implementing a specific onWidgetDestroyed listener for this. Listening purely for onWidgetRemoved, and if for some reason my listener was fired before CUI's, it would be useless, as CUI's listener would remove it again from the DOM tree.",

CUI's own listener is added in CUI.init(), which runs synchronously when the module is loaded (Cu.import'd). There is therefore literally no way your listener can be added before CUI's own listener, AIUI. I'm pretty sure that if we reversed the order in which we run listeners, or otherwise messed with this, some of our automated and 'real life' tests would start failing, so I don't think this'll be changing in a hurry.\n\nThis all seems pretty niche. I'm going to mark this P5. If someone wants to implement it, they can, but there are so many actual user-facing bugs to work on that I can't justify spending time on this right now.\n\nThe relevant code is in CustomizableUI.jsm.

Go to History menu -> Clear Recent History -> choose to clear Everything\n5. Click on the Filehippo feeds \n6. Close Firefox\n7. Launch Firefox.\n\nThe RSS visit indicator should change after step 4, not after step 7."

Since no browser-chrome tests exist for dom/plugins/test right now, you can crib examples from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/newtab/Makefile.in and http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/test/browser_bug763468.js?force=1"

In that case however it wouldn't be easy to glance at the context, so I think option 1 would be preferable.",

So eventually I managed to track down the nsDocument::InitializeFrameLoader which is where the frame gets added to the mInitializableFrameLoaders array to eventually be loaded/displayed (at this point the URI has already been set and cuts off at child2).\n\nSo I traced this back even further to find NS_NewURI which eventually calls nsStandardURL::Resolve. Inside, I further tracked the change from relative to absolute to the call to nsBaseURLParser::ParseURL. Inside this function the parameter \"const char *spec\" turns from being relative to absolute although I have no idea how :) /end brain dump"

I have a bunch of things I want to read in the morning, and I want them all to preload and be ready for me to read. \n\nI've been doing it this way for years, and the new Firefox breaks this use case. There aren't \"30 tabs\" opening when I do this; just the dozen or so I want to open. And no, I don't want to go through and click a dozen times when I really just want them all to open quickly.\n\nAnd no, I don't want to create a set of bookmark folders that only Firefox knows about. I can use Firefox sync to sync that with other Firefox instances, but I can't sync with Chrome or get access to the links from the web. Having a set of folders in Firefox and another set in Chrome and another on my mobile device is a violation of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Having them all in one place on a cross-browser service is much cleaner for me. So please fix.",

So PLEASE restore this functionality. \n\nI point a bunch of tabs at my own Pinboard.im feeds (formerly my Delicious feeds). They only rarely change. I have a bunch of things I want to read in the morning, and I want them all to preload and be ready for me to read. \n\nI've been doing it this way for years, and the new Firefox breaks this use case. There aren't \"30 tabs\" opening when I do this; just the dozen or so I want to open. And no, I don't want to go through and click a dozen times when I really just want them all to open quickly.\n\nAnd no, I don't want to create a set of bookmark folders that only Firefox knows about. I can use Firefox sync to sync that with other Firefox instances, but I can't sync with Chrome or get access to the links from the web. Having a set of folders in Firefox and another set in Chrome and another on my mobile device is a violation of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Having them all in one place on a cross-browser service is much cleaner for me. So please fix."

I can't speed those up as they are a core implementation and should be quick. If they're not we should make them faster because every web site using that would benefit (though that surely isn't that simple).

In order to pre populate the links, we need to detect the first time a profile runs. I create a new pref, since I can't not use any of the existing preferences, like 'browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone', because the new tab module runs until a new tab is opened and in that moment those preferences are already changed.\n\n2. By default, the first run page is loaded and added to the browser history. So, I'm using only two links to pre populate the new tab: http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/central/ and https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/.\n\n3. When building the link object, we need the url and the title of the page. Currently, I'm not using any title, so the url appears as the title. Should we have the titles localized for this?\n\n4. With the pre populated links, the page thumbnails are empty, since those links have not been loaded yet. Any suggestions for this?",
